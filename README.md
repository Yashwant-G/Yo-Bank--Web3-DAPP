# Yo-Bank--Web3-DAPP
This is a Decentralized Bank made using Solidity and smart contracts and React as frontend. I have used truffle to interact with the smart contracts and Ganache as a test Ethereum network. Here we can deposit our tokens from Metamask wallet and gain some dummy reward tokens. You need to have ganache network to connect with this webApp. Some things are yet to be added in this project

Steps to run:-
1. Install Ganache and quick start it.
2. Add Ganache Network on MetaMask
3. Take one of the test network, copy its private key and import it on MetaMask Ganache Network.
4. That's it, you are Ready to go.
